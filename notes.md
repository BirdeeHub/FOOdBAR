To get the result of a media query for `prefers-color-scheme` in JavaScript and post it to an endpoint, you can follow these steps:

1. Use `window.matchMedia()` to check if the user's preferred color scheme matches a specific media query.
2. Extract the result of the media query.
3. Send the result to an endpoint using an HTTP request. You can use `fetch()` to perform this.

Here's a basic example:

```javascript
// Check if the user prefers dark mode
const darkModeQuery = window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)');
const isDarkMode = darkModeQuery.matches;

// Define the data to be sent
const data = {
  isDarkMode: isDarkMode
};

// Define the endpoint URL
const endpoint = 'https://example.com/endpoint';

// Define the fetch options
const options = {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(data)
};

// Send the data to the endpoint
fetch(endpoint, options)
  .then(response => {
    if (response.ok) {
      console.log('Data successfully sent to the endpoint');
    } else {
      console.error('Failed to send data to the endpoint');
    }
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```

In this example:
- We use `window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')` to check if the user prefers dark mode.
- The `matches` property of the media query result indicates whether the condition is met.
- We define the data to be sent as an object with a key `isDarkMode` containing the result of the media query.
- We define the endpoint URL where we want to send the data.
- We use `fetch()` to make a POST request to the endpoint with the data.
- We handle the response from the endpoint to log success or failure.

Ensure to replace `'https://example.com/endpoint'` with the actual endpoint URL where you want to send the data. Also, handle errors and responses appropriately based on your requirements.

#sqlite


Using SQLite in Go is relatively straightforward thanks to the `database/sql` package provided by the Go standard library and the `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` package, which serves as a SQLite driver for Go.

Here's a simple step-by-step guide on how to use SQLite in Go:

1. **Install SQLite3**: Ensure that SQLite3 is installed on your system. You can download it from the SQLite website if it's not already installed.

2. **Install the SQLite Driver for Go**: You can use the `go get` command to install the SQLite driver package:
   ```
   go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
   ```

3. **Import Required Packages**: Import the necessary packages in your Go file.
   ```go
   import (
       "database/sql"
       _ "github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3"
   )
   ```

4. **Open a Database Connection**: Use the `sql.Open` function to establish a connection to your SQLite database.
   ```go
   db, err := sql.Open("sqlite3", "path/to/your/database.db")
   if err != nil {
       log.Fatal(err)
   }
   defer db.Close()
   ```

5. **Create Tables (if needed)**: You can execute SQL statements to create tables if they don't exist already.
   ```go
   _, err = db.Exec(`
       CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
           id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
           name TEXT,
           email TEXT
       )
   `)
   if err != nil {
       log.Fatal(err)
   }
   ```

6. **Perform Database Operations**: You can perform various database operations like insert, update, delete, and select using `db.Exec` and `db.Query` methods.
   ```go
   // Insert data
   _, err = db.Exec("INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (?, ?)", "John Doe", "john@example.com")
   if err != nil {
       log.Fatal(err)
   }

   // Query data
   rows, err := db.Query("SELECT id, name, email FROM users")
   if err != nil {
       log.Fatal(err)
   }
   defer rows.Close()

   for rows.Next() {
       var id int
       var name, email string
       err := rows.Scan(&id, &name, &email)
       if err != nil {
           log.Fatal(err)
       }
       fmt.Println(id, name, email)
   }
   ```

7. **Handle Errors**: Always check and handle errors properly to ensure your application behaves as expected.

8. **Close the Connection**: Don't forget to close the database connection when you're done using it.

That's it! You now have a basic understanding of how to use SQLite in Go. You can build upon this foundation to create more complex database-driven applications.



> I want my database to contain user tables, containing a table for each tab type. right now it just has example stuff and what I think is how you initialize a database?

> 		log.Fatal(err)
> 	}
> 	defer db.Close()
> }
> ```

Here is how you could structure the database to have separate tables for each tab type per user:

1. Create a users table to store user info:

```go
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 
  name TEXT,
  email TEXT
);
```

2. Create separate tables for each tab type, with a user id column to associate with a user:

```go 
CREATE TABLE user_recipes (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER, 
  name TEXT,
  // other recipe columns
);

CREATE TABLE user_pantry (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 
  user_id INTEGER,
  name TEXT,
  // other pantry columns
);

// Similarly for other tab types - shopping, menu, etc
```

3. When reading/writing tab data, lookup the user id first, then query the appropriate table:

```go
func readRecipes(userID uuid.UUID) {

  // Lookup user id
  row := db.QueryRow("SELECT id FROM users WHERE id = ?", userID)
  var userID int 
  row.Scan(&userID)

  // Get recipes for user
  rows, _ := db.Query("SELECT * FROM user_recipes WHERE user_id = ?", userID)
  
  // Process rows
}

// Similarly for other tab types
```

So in summary:
- Separate tables per tab type associated with user id
- Lookup user id first 
- Query appropriate table for that user

Let me know if this helps or if you need any clarification!

> can tables in sqlite contain pointers to other tables?
> 
> Can I create a separate set of tables for each user instead of having the userdata just be rows in a user_pantry table?

Yes, SQLite supports foreign keys which allow you to reference rows in another table. This can be used to create separate tables per user.

Here is an example schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE user_1_recipes (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 
  recipe_name TEXT,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) 
);

CREATE TABLE user_2_recipes (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  recipe_name TEXT,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id)
);

CREATE TABLE user_1_pantry (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  ingredient TEXT,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id)
); 

CREATE TABLE user_2_pantry (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  ingredient TEXT, 
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

This creates a separate recipes and pantry table for each user, with a `user_id` column that references the `id` column in the `users` table.

When inserting data, you would lookup the user id, then insert into the appropriate per-user table.

The main downside is the table structure is not dynamic - you have to know all the user ids ahead of time to create the tables. An alternative is a single table per tab type with a `user_id` column.

So in summary, yes SQLite supports separate per-user tables through foreign keys, but it requires knowing user ids upfront. Let me know if you have any other questions!

> how to select items conditionally from a database?

Here are a few ways to conditionally select data from a database in SQL:

**WHERE clause**

Use a WHERE clause to filter rows based on a condition:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table WHERE column_name = some_value
```

**CASE statement** 

Use a CASE statement to selectively output columns based on conditions:

```sql
SELECT 
  CASE WHEN condition THEN column_1 ELSE column_2 END AS column
FROM table
```

**IF function**

Some databases support an IF function to return one value or another conditionally:

```sql 
SELECT 
  IF(condition, column_1, column_2) AS column
FROM table
``` 

**JOINs**

Join tables together conditionally to select related data:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM table_1
LEFT JOIN table_2 ON table_1.id = table_2.foreign_key
WHERE table_2.id IS NULL
```

This will select rows from table_1 that don't have a match in table_2.

**UNION** 

Combine the results of multiple SELECT statements conditionally:

```sql
SELECT column FROM table WHERE condition_1
UNION 
SELECT column FROM table WHERE condition_2
```

This allows you to select rows meeting different conditions in one query.

So in summary, use WHERE, CASE, IF, JOINS, and UNION to add conditional logic to your SELECT queries.

> If, for example, I wanted to select the highest 50 values of a column, instead of all matching the criteria, how would I do this effectively?

To select only the top N values from a column, you can use the LIMIT clause along with ORDER BY.

For example, to select the 50 highest values from a "score" column:

```sql
SELECT score
FROM table
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

This will:

1. Order the rows by score in descending order (highest first)

2. Return only the first 50 rows 

So we get the top 50 highest scores.

You can also combine this with WHERE clauses to filter before selecting the top values:

```sql 
SELECT score
FROM table
WHERE condition
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

Some key points:

- ORDER BY determines the sorting order before the LIMIT is applied.

- You need to specify DESC to sort highest first, otherwise it will give the lowest values.

- LIMIT without ORDER BY will give arbitrary rows rather than top values.

So in summary, use ORDER BY and LIMIT together to get the top N rows according to a specified ordering. Add a WHERE clause to filter before selecting top values.
