# This repo is an extreme work in progress, it is NOT EVEN CLOSE TO FINISHED!!!!

## This is my first attempt at making a webpage,
## It is also my first time using go, htmx, sql, js, html, css, templ, authentication, routing, etc.

This program will be a tracker app for a friend's small catering/personal chef buisness when it is finished.

Mostly though, it is a way for me to learn web development as I have not done any before.

There will likely be some spaghetti that I will figure out how to handle better as I go.

### Install and development building instructions

For now it is packaged for nix only so install nix package manager, then clone the repo and cd into it

Then to build or run use ```nix build --show-trace``` or ```nix run --show-trace```

and to hack around with it with hot reload run the following 2 commands:

```bash
nix develop --show-trace
# then inside the shell:
air
```

If you dont want to install nix, the following should work, and the air command might work, assuming you have go, templ, and sqlite3 installed.
```bash
go mod tidy && templ generate && go build -o dist/FOOdBAR ./FOOdBAR/main.go
```
-OR-
```bash
air
```

### Name:

It's FU'd Beyond Any Recognition

The FOOdBAR tracks the food in the FOOdb and tells you how much FOOd you have and sold and what it cost,
and reminds you of recipes that fit those criteria best. Allowing you to cook more variety with less headache

### Done so far:

setup go, htmx, templ, echo project

made it be buildable by nix, and included a dev shell

defined the basic api routes and templates needed for the tab skeleton

set up authentication via JWT and auth database

defined skeleton of runtime state type objects

defined part of the skeleton for the tabs themselves

### TODO AND IDEAS:
database for tab items

expandable elements for tab items

Would be nice to have dynamic resizing with the mouse

infinite scroll for all list style tabs

write some damn tests

make it http*S*

shopping price search feature?

styling/animation?

recipe list and entry

suggestion based on stock

sort recipe by category, dietary, ingredients, % ingredients in stock, (total ingredient price?)

generate prep list, and shopping list (accounts for current stock), the menu, and projected and actual portions ordered.

track what was bought and then used after the day to keep track of the total stock, as actual amounts may differ based on prices for different quantities at stores.

total workflow, 3 interaction stages. Generate menu, input orders and generate the lists, input actual stock bought and used to correct suggested values.

6 tab interface? recipe database, menu tab where you have the menu and track orders, prep list, shopping list, stock list, profit review


recipes will need category, dietary, ingredients, estimated cost, fields, ingredients should have an optional scaling factor for scaling recipes accurately

ingredients will need amounts in stock, time since purchased, storage method, (last queried price?)

when all data for stock and menu and orders have been finalized for the week, generate profit report, with option for adding extra incidental costs.

Interface will be written as a web page, because I want to learn how to make an interactive web page, and I will be using go + htmx to do it.

Run the program, and then visit localhost:42069 (or other configured value)

recipe entry should have completion for existing items in ingredients dietary, category, etc but not for name or instructions or amounts or prices.

### SQL


> can tables in sqlite contain pointers to other tables?
> Can I create a separate set of tables for each user instead of having the userdata just be rows in a user_pantry table?

Yes, SQLite supports foreign keys which allow you to reference rows in another table. This can be used to create separate tables per user.

Here is an example schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE user_1_recipes (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 
  recipe_name TEXT,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) 
);

CREATE TABLE user_2_recipes (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  recipe_name TEXT,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id)
);

CREATE TABLE user_1_pantry (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  ingredient TEXT,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id)
); 

CREATE TABLE user_2_pantry (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  ingredient TEXT, 
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

This creates a separate recipes and pantry table for each user, with a `user_id` column that references the `id` column in the `users` table.

When inserting data, you would lookup the user id, then insert into the appropriate per-user table.

The main downside is the table structure is not dynamic - you have to know all the user ids ahead of time to create the tables. An alternative is a single table per tab type with a `user_id` column.

So in summary, yes SQLite supports separate per-user tables through foreign keys, but it requires knowing user ids upfront. Let me know if you have any other questions!

> how to select items conditionally from a database?

Here are a few ways to conditionally select data from a database in SQL:

**WHERE clause**

Use a WHERE clause to filter rows based on a condition:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table WHERE column_name = some_value
```

**CASE statement** 

Use a CASE statement to selectively output columns based on conditions:

```sql
SELECT 
  CASE WHEN condition THEN column_1 ELSE column_2 END AS column
FROM table
```

**IF function**

Some databases support an IF function to return one value or another conditionally:

```sql 
SELECT 
  IF(condition, column_1, column_2) AS column
FROM table
``` 

**JOINs**

Join tables together conditionally to select related data:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM table_1
LEFT JOIN table_2 ON table_1.id = table_2.foreign_key
WHERE table_2.id IS NULL
```

This will select rows from table_1 that don't have a match in table_2.

**UNION** 

Combine the results of multiple SELECT statements conditionally:

```sql
SELECT column FROM table WHERE condition_1
UNION 
SELECT column FROM table WHERE condition_2
```

This allows you to select rows meeting different conditions in one query.

So in summary, use WHERE, CASE, IF, JOINS, and UNION to add conditional logic to your SELECT queries.

> If, for example, I wanted to select the highest 50 values of a column, instead of all matching the criteria, how would I do this effectively?

To select only the top N values from a column, you can use the LIMIT clause along with ORDER BY.

For example, to select the 50 highest values from a "score" column:

```sql
SELECT score
FROM table
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

This will:

1. Order the rows by score in descending order (highest first)

2. Return only the first 50 rows 

So we get the top 50 highest scores.

You can also combine this with WHERE clauses to filter before selecting the top values:

```sql 
SELECT score
FROM table
WHERE condition
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

Some key points:

- ORDER BY determines the sorting order before the LIMIT is applied.

- You need to specify DESC to sort highest first, otherwise it will give the lowest values.

- LIMIT without ORDER BY will give arbitrary rows rather than top values.

So in summary, use ORDER BY and LIMIT together to get the top N rows according to a specified ordering. Add a WHERE clause to filter before selecting top values.

> what other things can I sort by?

In SQL, including SQLite, there are various ways to sort data beyond just ascending and descending order. Here are some common sorting options:

1. **Ascending Order (ASC)**: This is the default sorting order if not specified explicitly. It sorts the data from the lowest value to the highest.

    ```sql
    SELECT column_name
    FROM table_name
    ORDER BY column_name ASC;
    ```

2. **Descending Order (DESC)**: It sorts the data from the highest value to the lowest.

    ```sql
    SELECT column_name
    FROM table_name
    ORDER BY column_name DESC;
    ```

3. **Alphabetical Order (ASC/DESC)**: For text data, you can sort alphabetically. This follows the natural order of the characters in the specified collation.

    ```sql
    SELECT column_name
    FROM table_name
    ORDER BY column_name ASC;
    ```

4. **Custom Sorting**: You can also use a custom sorting order using the `CASE` statement to define specific sorting criteria.

    ```sql
    SELECT column_name
    FROM table_name
    ORDER BY
        CASE 
            WHEN condition THEN value
            WHEN condition THEN value
            ELSE value
        END;
    ```

5. **Sorting by Multiple Columns**: You can sort by multiple columns. Rows with the same value in the first column are then sorted by the second column, and so on.

    ```sql
    SELECT column_name1, column_name2
    FROM table_name
    ORDER BY column_name1 ASC, column_name2 DESC;
    ```

6. **Random Order**: To retrieve data in a random order, you can use the `RANDOM()` or `RAND()` function depending on the database system.

    ```sql
    SELECT column_name
    FROM table_name
    ORDER BY RANDOM();
    ```

These are some of the common sorting options available in SQL, but the specifics may vary depending on the database system you're using.
